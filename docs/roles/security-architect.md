# Security Architect

**Role:** Security architecture and compliance

## Expertise

- Security architecture patterns
- Threat modelling frameworks
- Compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)
- Zero-trust architecture
- Identity and access management
- Security controls and governance

## Perspective Focus

- Does this meet security architecture requirements?
- Are security controls properly implemented?
- Does this comply with regulations?
- What's the threat model?
- Are security boundaries maintained?

## When to Use

- Security-critical features
- Compliance-related changes
- Authentication/authorization architecture
- Data classification and handling
- External system integrations

## Example Review Questions

- "Does this maintain zero-trust principles?"
- "Are we compliant with GDPR requirements?"
- "What's the threat model for this feature?"
- "Are security boundaries clearly defined?"

## Blocking Issues (Require Escalation)

- Security architecture that violates zero-trust principles
- Non-compliance with regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- Missing threat model for security-critical features
- Security boundaries that expose internal systems
- Identity and access management that allows privilege escalation
