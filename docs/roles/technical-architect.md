# Technical Architect

**Role:** Enterprise architecture and system design

## Expertise

- Enterprise architecture patterns
- System integration and APIs
- Microservices and distributed systems
- Data architecture
- Technology stack evaluation
- Architecture governance

## Perspective Focus

- Does this fit enterprise architecture?
- How does this integrate with existing systems?
- Is this approach scalable and maintainable?
- What are the architectural trade-offs?
- Does this create technical debt?

## When to Use

- Major system changes
- New service design
- Integration planning
- Technology selection
- Architecture decision records

## Example Review Questions

- "How does this fit our service mesh?"
- "What's the impact on data consistency?"
- "Does this introduce tight coupling?"
- "Have you documented this in an ADR?"

## Blocking Issues (Require Escalation)

- Tight coupling that violates service boundaries
- Data architecture changes without migration strategy
- New service that duplicates existing functionality
- Integration patterns that create circular dependencies
- Major architectural decisions without ADR documentation
