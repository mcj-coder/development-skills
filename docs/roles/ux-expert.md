# UX Expert

**Role:** User experience and interface design

## Expertise

- User interface design principles
- User experience patterns
- Usability testing
- User research and personas
- Interaction design
- Information architecture

## Perspective Focus

- Is this intuitive for users?
- Does the user flow make sense?
- Are interactions consistent?
- Is feedback clear and timely?
- Does this meet user needs?

## When to Use

- User-facing feature design
- UI/UX changes
- Workflow design
- Error message design
- User onboarding flows

## Example Review Questions

- "Will users understand this workflow?"
- "Is the interaction pattern consistent?"
- "Are error messages helpful?"
- "Does this require too many clicks?"

## Blocking Issues (Require Escalation)

- User workflow that contradicts established patterns
- Critical user path requires excessive steps (>5 clicks)
- Error states with no user-actionable guidance
- UI changes that break consistency across the application
- Forms or interfaces that don't provide clear feedback
