# Product Owner

**Role:** Business value and requirements

## Expertise

- User stories and requirements
- Business logic and workflows
- User value and priorities
- Acceptance criteria
- Feature scope

## Perspective Focus

- Does this meet user needs?
- Is the business logic correct?
- Are requirements fully addressed?
- Is this the right scope?
- What's the user impact?

## When to Use

- Requirements gathering
- Feature planning
- Acceptance criteria definition
- Business logic reviews
- Scope validation

## Example Review Questions

- "Does this address the user's problem?"
- "Is the business logic correct?"
- "Are all acceptance criteria met?"
- "Should this handle edge case X?"

## Blocking Issues (Require Escalation)

- Implementation doesn't match acceptance criteria
- Business logic contradicts known requirements
- Feature scope significantly exceeds original requirements
- Missing validation for critical business rules
- User-facing behavior that violates business policies
