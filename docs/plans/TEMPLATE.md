## Deployment Strategy

### For Single Issues

**Deployment:** Standard merge to main, deploy to production

### For Epics – Choose One

#### Strategy A: Feature Flags (Preferred)

**Feature Flags:**

**CRITICAL**: No breaking changes or behaviour changes are allowed in this strategy while feature flags are disabled.

| Flag Name                   | Sub-Issue | Purpose                                | Default State |
| --------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `ParentFeature`             | Epic      | Parent flag controlling entire feature | `disabled`    |
| `ParentFeature.SubFeature1` | #XXX      | Sub-feature 1                          | `disabled`    |
| `ParentFeature.SubFeature2` | #XXX      | Sub-feature 2                          | `disabled`    |

**Flag Configuration:**

- **Local Dev:** `appsettings.Development.json`
- **Production:** Azure App Configuration Service

**Enablement Plan:**

1. All sub-issues merge to the main with flags disabled
2. Test each sub-feature independently by enabling its flag
3. When all sub-issues complete, enable parent flag
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Document enablement date in this plan

**Flag Removal:**

- **Target:** two releases after enablement
- **Ticket:** Create a follow-up issue for flag removal

**Base Branch:** All sub-issues branch from `main`

#### Strategy B: Feature Branch (Fallback)

**Feature Branch:** `feature/{issue#}-{feature-name}`

**Process:**

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Keep feature branch rebased with `main` (epic owner responsibility)
3. All sub-issues branch from the feature branch
4. Sub-issues merge to feature branch
5. Final epic PR merges feature branch → `main`

**Base Branch:** All sub-issues branch from `feature/{issue#}-{feature-name}`

**Why Strategy B:**

- Cannot safely deploy sub-issues independently
- Sub-features tightly coupled
- Breaking changes require all-or-nothing deployment

## Work Breakdown

### Strategy & Granularity

- **For Epics:** Provide a high-level breakdown at the component/deliverable unit level. Capture the epic's requirements
  and deliverables into the sub-tickets listed below. Explain how the sub-tickets interrelate and which skill sets should
  be involved in each.
- **For Sub-issues/Single Ticket Features:** Provide a detailed plan with a task breakdown. Each task should be small enough
  (1–4 hours) to be wrapped appropriately.

### Sub-Issues

| Sub-Issue      | Title   | Description       | Skillsets Required | Dependencies | Estimate |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| [#XXX]({Link}) | {Title} | Brief description | e.g. skill:dotnet  | None         | X days   |
| [#XXX]({Link}) | {Title} | Brief description | e.g. skill:testing | #YYY         | X days   |

All sub-issues must link back to this ticket and the design plan with an immutable URL.

### Task Breakdown

| Task | Description | Role/Skillset | Estimate |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 1    | {Task name} | e.g. DotNet   | 2h       |
| 2    | {Task name} | e.g. QA       | 1h       |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk               | Likelihood   | Impact       | Mitigation           |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Risk 1 description | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | How we're mitigating |
| Risk 2 description | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | How we're mitigating |

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- **Dependency 1:** What we need from our codebase
- **Dependency 2:** Another internal dependency

### External Dependencies

- **Service/Library 1:** What we need externally
- **Service/Library 2:** Another external dependency

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers

Key implementation guidance:

- Important patterns to follow
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Specific libraries/frameworks to use

### For Reviewers

What to focus on during code review:

- Critical paths requiring extra scrutiny
- Performance-sensitive areas
- Security-sensitive code
- Complex logic that needs careful review

---

## Follow-up Issues

Issues created during implementation/review for future work:

| Issue      | Title | Reason | Target Release | Status |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | -------------- | ------ |
| (none yet) | -     | -      | -              | -      |

**Note:** All follow-up issues should link back to this design plan and parent epic.

### When to Create Follow-ups

- Performance optimisations (if current performance is acceptable)
- Additional test scenarios (if coverage adequate)
- Documentation improvements (if basics are complete)
- Future enhancements identified during implementation
- Refactoring opportunities (if code acceptable)

### Not Acceptable for Follow-up

- Blockers (security, bugs, violations) – must fix in current PR
- Missing acceptance criteria – must be complete now
- Broken tests must be fixed now
- Missing required documentation – must add now

### Amendment Process

When implementation deviates from design or scope changes:

1. Append amendment to the version history table and Approvals header
2. Append "Amendment #N" Section to the end of the design plan
3. Add update details to relevant sections within the amendment section (diff from original details)
4. Link to PR comment or issue discussion
5. Get Tech Lead approval (Approval link)
6. Get Product Owner approval (Approval link) (if applicable/change in scope/functionality)
7. Add updated immutable links in sub-issues if needed
