# Task 4: Update agent-workitem-automation Skill - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] agent-workitem-automation references BDD checklist templates
- [ ] Clarifies verification requirements before opening PR
- [ ] Distinguishes concrete vs process-only verification
- [ ] Aligns with issue-driven-delivery requirements

**Failure Notes:**
- Current "Delivery Completion" section (lines 130-148) has basic evidence statement
- Doesn't reference BDD checklist templates
- No distinction between concrete and process-only verification
- Brief mention but lacks detail

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

Will verify after updating agent-workitem-automation skill with all required content.
