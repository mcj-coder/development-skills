# Task 7: Update README.md TDD Section - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] README.md TDD section references BDD checklist templates
- [ ] Clarifies verification requirements for documentation changes
- [ ] Distinguishes concrete documentation changes from process-only
- [ ] Consistent with AGENTS.md requirements
- [ ] References `docs/references/bdd-checklist-templates.md`

**Failure Notes:**
- Current README.md TDD section (lines 24-34) explains BDD checklists for documentation
- Doesn't reference BDD checklist templates
- Doesn't distinguish concrete vs process-only verification
- Doesn't link to templates for examples

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

Will verify after updating README.md TDD section with all required content.
