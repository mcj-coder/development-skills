# Skill Application Verification Policy (BDD Checklist)

## RED: Failing checklist before edits

- [ ] AGENTS.md requires concrete skill application when changes are made.
- [ ] AGENTS.md allows hypothetical analysis only for process-only skills.
- [ ] github-issue-driven-delivery blocks PRs without evidence of applied skill.
- [ ] agent-workitem-automation blocks PRs without evidence of applied skill.

**Failure notes:**

- Current guidance allows analysis-only BDD even when changes are concrete.
- PR gating is not tied to applied-skill evidence.
