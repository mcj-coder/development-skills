# Archived Implementation Plans

This directory contains completed implementation plans for reference.

## Purpose

Plans are archived here after work items are closed to:
- Preserve planning history and design decisions
- Keep active plans directory clean (plans in feature branches only)
- Provide reference for future similar work
- Document what was planned vs. what was implemented

## Archive Process

When closing a work item (step 10.5):
1. Move plan from `docs/plans/` to `docs/plans/archive/`
2. Commit: `git commit -m "docs: archive plan for issue #N"`
3. Archive is included in PR with implementation

## Naming Convention

Plans follow: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`

Date reflects when plan was created, not when archived.
