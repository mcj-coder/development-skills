# Task 1: Create BDD Checklist Templates - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] File `docs/references/bdd-checklist-templates.md` exists
- [ ] Contains concrete changes checklist template with applied evidence requirements
- [ ] Contains process-only checklist template with analytical verification guidance
- [ ] Includes 2+ examples for concrete changes
- [ ] Includes 2+ examples for process-only skills
- [ ] Clearly distinguishes when to use each template

**Failure Notes:**
- File does not exist yet
- No templates available for teams to reference
- No clear guidance on concrete vs process-only verification

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

Will verify after creating `docs/references/bdd-checklist-templates.md` with all required content.
