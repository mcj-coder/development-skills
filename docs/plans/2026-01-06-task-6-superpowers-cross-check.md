# Task 6: Cross-Check with Superpowers Skills - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] Documented integration with superpowers:test-driven-development in AGENTS.md
- [ ] Documented integration with superpowers:verification-before-completion in AGENTS.md
- [ ] No conflicting requirements identified
- [ ] Appropriate references to Superpowers skills in all documentation
- [ ] Clear distinction between this repo's concrete requirements and Superpowers process guidance

**Failure Notes:**
- Current documentation references Superpowers skills but doesn't explain integration
- No explicit documentation of how Superpowers TDD complements local BDD requirements
- Unclear relationship between superpowers:verification and local verification requirements
- Need to clarify this repo provides verification types, Superpowers provides process

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

Will verify after documenting Superpowers integration in AGENTS.md.
