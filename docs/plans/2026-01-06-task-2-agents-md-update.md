# Task 2: Update AGENTS.md with TDD/BDD Requirements - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] AGENTS.md contains expanded applied-skill evidence section
- [ ] Distinguishes concrete changes (require applied evidence) from process-only (analytical verification)
- [ ] References `docs/references/bdd-checklist-templates.md`
- [ ] Includes example of concrete verification with commit SHAs
- [ ] Includes example of process-only analytical verification
- [ ] States "TDD enforcement" section (line 20-21) applies to all changes including documentation

**Failure Notes:**
- Current AGENTS.md line 12-15 has basic applied-skill evidence requirement
- Lacks clarity on concrete vs process-only distinction
- No reference to BDD checklist templates
- No examples provided
- TDD enforcement section doesn't reference BDD checklists

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

Will verify after updating AGENTS.md with all required content.
