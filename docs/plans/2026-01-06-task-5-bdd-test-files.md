# Task 5: Create/Update BDD Test Files - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] issue-driven-delivery.test.md includes BDD verification test cases
- [ ] agent-workitem-automation has .test.md with BDD verification scenarios
- [ ] markdown-author.test.md demonstrates concrete change verification
- [ ] skills-first-workflow.test.md demonstrates process-only verification
- [ ] Each test file shows RED (failing) state before skill applied
- [ ] Each test file shows GREEN (passing) state after skill applied

**Failure Notes:**
- issue-driven-delivery.test.md exists but doesn't cover BDD verification requirements
- agent-workitem-automation.test.md exists but needs BDD verification scenarios
- markdown-author.test.md exists but needs concrete verification example
- skills-first-workflow.test.md exists but needs process-only verification example
- Need to add specific test cases for concrete vs process-only verification

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

Will verify after creating/updating test files with BDD verification scenarios.
