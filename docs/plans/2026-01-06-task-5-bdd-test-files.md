# Task 5: Create/Update BDD Test Files - BDD Verification

## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] issue-driven-delivery.test.md includes BDD verification test cases
- [ ] agent-workitem-automation has .test.md with BDD verification scenarios
- [ ] markdown-author.test.md demonstrates concrete change verification
- [ ] skills-first-workflow.test.md demonstrates process-only verification
- [ ] Each test file shows RED (failing) state before skill applied
- [ ] Each test file shows GREEN (passing) state after skill applied

**Failure Notes:**
- issue-driven-delivery.test.md exists but doesn't cover BDD verification requirements
- agent-workitem-automation.test.md exists but needs BDD verification scenarios
- markdown-author.test.md exists but needs concrete verification example
- skills-first-workflow.test.md exists but needs process-only verification example
- Need to add specific test cases for concrete vs process-only verification

## GREEN: Passing Checklist (After Implementation)

- [x] issue-driven-delivery.test.md includes BDD verification test cases
- [x] agent-workitem-automation has .test.md with BDD verification scenarios
- [x] markdown-author.test.md demonstrates concrete change verification
- [x] skills-first-workflow.test.md demonstrates process-only verification
- [x] Each test file shows RED (failing) state before skill applied
- [x] Each test file shows GREEN (passing) state after skill applied

**Applied Evidence:**
- Updated issue-driven-delivery.test.md with BDD verification pressure scenario and 4 test cases (RED/GREEN)
- Updated agent-workitem-automation.test.md with BDD verification test cases (RED/GREEN)
- Updated markdown-author.test.md with concrete change verification examples
- Updated skills-first-workflow.test.md with process-only verification examples
- All test files now demonstrate distinction between concrete and process-only verification
- Each includes RED (failure without skill) and GREEN (success with skill) scenarios
