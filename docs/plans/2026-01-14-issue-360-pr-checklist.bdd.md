## RED: Failing Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` contains an "Autonomous PR Checklist" section
- [ ] Checklist section includes a copy-ready PR comment template
- [ ] Template includes Summary, Issues, Test plan with evidence links, and Verification
- [ ] Checklist section states auto-merge must be enabled once approvals and checks pass

**Failure Notes:**

- No autonomous PR checklist section exists in `AGENTS.md`
- No copy-ready template exists for autonomous PR comments
- Auto-merge requirement is not explicitly documented for agents
