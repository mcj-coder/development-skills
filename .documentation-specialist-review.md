## Review Criteria

### 1. Documentation Clarity

**Question:** Is this documented clearly? Will users understand how to use this?

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT

**Findings:**

**A. Baseline Rules (Lines 8-24)**

**Strengths:**
- **Bold key terms** make rules scannable ("No changes without a Taskboard issue")
- **Explicit timing** removes ambiguity ("before starting work", "Create the issue first")
- **Nested bullet structure** organizes sub-rules logically
- **Concrete examples** make abstract concepts actionable

**Example of Clarity:**
```markdown
- **Read-only work** (no ticket required): Code viewing, analysis, research,
  documentation reading, answering questions, providing reviews
```
→ Immediately clear: 6 examples cover common scenarios, parenthetical clarifies rule

**B. Taskboard Workflow Section (Lines 45-113)**

**Strengths:**
- **Numbered lifecycle states** provide clear progression (1-5)
- **Phase names** use both formal and informal terms ("Refinement (Planning phase)")
- **Bullet lists** break complex processes into discrete actions
- **Bold subsection headers** ("Issue Lifecycle:", "State Transition Rules:")

**Example of Clarity:**
```markdown
2. **Refinement** (Planning phase)
   - Self-assign when starting refinement
   - Create implementation plan on feature branch
   [...]
```
→ Phase purpose clear, actions specific and ordered

**C. Terminology Consistency**

✅ **Consistent throughout:**
- "Taskboard" (not "task board" or "issue tracker")
- "Read-only" vs "non-read-only" (parallel construction)
- "Issue" (not "ticket" except in skill names)
- State names match skill names (`refinement`, `implementation`, etc.)

**Assessment:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Coverage Analysis:**

| Aspect | Documented? | Location | Completeness |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| When to create issue | ✅ Yes | Lines 8-9 | 100% - "before starting work" |
| What needs ticket | ✅ Yes | Lines 13-14 | 100% - 6 examples |
| What doesn't need ticket | ✅ Yes | Lines 11-12 | 100% - 6 examples |
| Issue states | ✅ Yes | Lines 50-87 | 100% - All 5 states |
| State transitions | ✅ Yes | Lines 89-94 | 100% - Rules explicit |
| Evidence requirements | ✅ Yes | Lines 21-22, 96-102 | 100% - Per-transition |
| Traceability format | ✅ Yes | Lines 19-20 | 100% - With example |
| Issue closure | ✅ Yes | Lines 40-43, 82-87 | 100% - Criteria clear |
| Skills relationship | ✅ Yes | Lines 104-113 | 100% - Complementary clarified |

**No gaps identified.** All aspects of taskboard traceability baseline practice documented.

### 3. Documentation Structure

**Question:** Does the structure support comprehension and navigation?

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT

**Structural Analysis:**

**A. Hierarchical Organization**

✅ **Logical flow:**
1. Baseline rules (lines 8-43) → Mandatory requirements
2. Taskboard Workflow (lines 45-113) → Detailed implementation guidance
3. Structure progresses from "what" to "how"

**B. Section Headings**

✅ **Clear and descriptive:**
- `## Taskboard Workflow` (line 45) - Top-level section
- `**Issue Lifecycle:**` (line 50) - Subsection
- `**State Transition Rules:**` (line 89) - Subsection
- `**Evidence Requirements:**` (line 96) - Subsection
- `**Implementation Skills:**` (line 104) - Subsection

**C. Visual Hierarchy**

✅ **Effective use of formatting:**
- Bold for rule names: `**No changes without a Taskboard issue.**`
- Nested bullets for sub-rules and examples
- Numbered lists for sequential states (1-5)
- Code formatting for examples: `` `Refs: #123` ``

---

### 4. Examples and Usage Guidance

**Question:** Are examples helpful? Do they demonstrate practical application?

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT

**Examples Provided:**

1. **Read-only work examples** (line 11-12): 6 concrete scenarios
2. **Non-read-only work examples** (line 13-14): 6 concrete scenarios
3. **Traceability format example** (line 19): `` `Refs: #123` `` - immediately usable
4. **State names** (lines 15-16, 50-87): Actual state labels to use
5. **Evidence per transition** (lines 100-102): Specific links required

**Quality of Examples:**

✅ **Comprehensive coverage:**
- Read-only: Covers research, analysis, review scenarios
- Non-read-only: Covers coding, documentation, configuration scenarios
- Format: Shows exact syntax to use

✅ **Actionable:**
- Can copy-paste `` `Refs: #123` `` format
- State names match actual labels
- Evidence requirements are specific ("commit SHA URL", "test results")

**No abstract or ambiguous examples.** All examples are concrete and immediately applicable.

---

### 5. Consistency with Repository Standards

**Question:** Does this align with existing documentation standards?

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT ALIGNMENT

**Alignment Check:**

**A. With README.md**

✅ **Consistent:**
- README.md has "Work Items" section with taskboard link (lines 7-9)
- AGENTS.md references taskboard requirement (lines 8-24)
- Complementary: README for humans, AGENTS.md for agents
- No contradictions

**B. With Human-Centric Documentation Principle (AGENTS.md lines 51-111)**

✅ **Follows principle:**
- Uses human-readable terminology ("Refinement", "Planning phase")
- Skill names qualified ("`development-skills:issue-driven-delivery`")
- Implementation skills vs baseline separated clearly (lines 104-113)
- Matches table on line 63-73: "Skill Concern → Document In"

**C. With Skills-First Workflow (AGENTS.md lines 143-172)**

✅ **Compatible:**
- Taskboard workflow doesn't conflict with skills-first requirement
- Refinement phase (lines 57-64) aligns with `writing-plans` skill
- Implementation phase (lines 66-72) aligns with `test-driven-development` skill
- Verification phase (lines 74-80) aligns with `verification-before-completion` skill

**D. With TDD Enforcement (AGENTS.md lines 33-34)**

✅ **Supports TDD:**
- Issue requirement doesn't override TDD requirement
- Both can coexist (create issue first, then apply TDD during implementation)
- Verification phase includes "Run tests" (line 76)

---

### 6. Technical Accuracy

**Question:** Is the information technically correct?

**Assessment:** ✅ ACCURATE

**Technical Review:**

**A. State Lifecycle**

✅ **Correct sequence:**
1. New Feature / Bug / Enhancement
2. Refinement
3. Implementation
4. Verification
5. Complete

This matches standard agile/kanban workflows and aligns with `issue-driven-delivery` skill (lines 36-37 of that skill).

**B. Traceability Format**

✅ **Valid format:**
- `` `Refs: #123` `` is valid GitHub commit message footer
- Commit SHA URLs are immutable references (security best practice)
- Issue comments with evidence links follow GitHub conventions

**C. Assignment Pattern**

✅ **Correct pull-based pattern:**
- "Self-assign when starting" (lines 58, 67, 75) enables pull-based coordination
- "Unassign after complete" (lines 64, 72, 80) signals availability
- Matches `issue-driven-delivery` assignment workflow (lines 104-112 of that skill)

**D. Evidence Requirements**

✅ **Appropriate scope:**
- Commit SHA URLs prevent TOCTOU attacks (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use)
- Evidence per transition maintains audit trail
- Final evidence on closure enables retrospective analysis

---

### 7. Accessibility and Readability

**Question:** Is this accessible to all skill levels? Is the reading level appropriate?

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT ACCESSIBILITY

**Readability Analysis:**

**A. Sentence Structure**

✅ **Clear and concise:**
- Average sentence length: ~15-20 words (ideal range)
- Active voice used throughout
- No jargon without explanation

**B. Progressive Disclosure**

✅ **Well-layered:**
- Baseline rules (lines 8-24): High-level requirements
- Taskboard Workflow (lines 45-113): Detailed implementation
- Can read baseline alone for overview, or drill down for details

**C. Target Audience**

✅ **Appropriate for agents:**
- Imperative statements ("Create the issue first")
- Specific, actionable language
- No ambiguity or interpretation required

**D. Scanability**

✅ **Easy to scan:**
- Bold key terms visible at a glance
- Bullet structure allows quick location of specific rules
- Numbered lists for sequential processes
- Code formatting highlights examples

## Recommendations

### None Required

This documentation meets or exceeds all standards. No changes recommended.

### Optional Enhancements (Future Consideration)

These are NOT blockers, just ideas for potential future enhancement:

1. **Visualize State Transitions (Optional)**
   - Consider adding an ASCII diagram of state flow
   - Would complement textual description
   - Not necessary, but could help visual learners

   ```
   Example:
   New → Refinement → Implementation → Verification → Complete
          ↑              ↓                ↓              ↓
       Assign       Unassign         Unassign       Auto-unassign
   ```

2. **Add "Common Mistakes" Section (Optional)**
   - Similar to what `issue-driven-delivery` skill includes
   - Could help agents avoid pitfalls
   - Not necessary for baseline documentation, but useful for comprehensive guidance

**Note:** These are suggestions for future iteration, NOT required for issue #41.
