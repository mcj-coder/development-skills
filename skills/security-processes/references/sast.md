# Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

## Objective

Detect insecure coding patterns early with actionable signal.

## Controls

- Run SAST in CI for PRs and merges.
- Treat high-confidence/high-severity findings as build-breaking.
- Require localized suppressions with justification and expiry (where applicable).
