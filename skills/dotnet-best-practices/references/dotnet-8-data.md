# Data and EF Core ecosystem in .NET 8 era

## Adopt now

- Re-run query performance baselines; remove stale workarounds if newer translation improves correctness/perf.
- Strengthen data access tests that encode behavioural expectations.

## Evaluate

- Additional LINQ/query translation capabilities in later EF versions if you are also upgrading EF.

## Avoid / caution

- Provider-specific undefined behaviors without explicit tests.
