# .NET 6 reference (LTS)

## Positioning

A stable LTS baseline. If you are still on .NET 6, default policy is to upgrade to the **latest LTS** when feasible.

## Progressive load (sub-references)

- `dotnet-6-runtime.md`
- `dotnet-6-sdk-tooling.md`
- `dotnet-6-aspnetcore.md`
- `dotnet-6-data.md`

## Adopt now / Evaluate / Avoid

Load the sub-references above. Each sub-reference uses:

- **Adopt now**: high-value items to plan/standardize
- **Evaluate**: selective adoption based on workload and constraints
- **Avoid / caution**: common pitfalls and upgrade hazards
