# ASP.NET Core in .NET 8

## Adopt now

- Standardize Minimal APIs vs controllers by boundary; apply consistent conventions.
- Use output caching improvements where they fit your architecture (validate cache variation and auth interactions).

## Evaluate

- Distributed output caching only with a clear invalidation strategy.

## Avoid / caution

- Caching authenticated or user-specific responses without explicit variation rules and tests.
