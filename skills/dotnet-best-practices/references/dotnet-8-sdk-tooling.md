# .NET 8 SDK and tooling

## Adopt now

- Pin SDK in CI and enforce consistent build settings.
- Adopt Central Package Management and enforce centralized versioning where supported.

## Evaluate

- Tighten analyzer gates (warnings-as-errors) incrementally to avoid destabilizing legacy codebases.

## Avoid / caution

- Mixed SDK versions and inconsistent analyzer baselines across projects.
