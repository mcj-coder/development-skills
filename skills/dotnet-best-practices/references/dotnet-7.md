# .NET 7 reference (STS)

## Positioning

An STS release. Use only when you need a specific platform feature ahead of the latest LTS.
Default production landing zone remains the **latest LTS**.

## Notable themes

- Continued runtime and library performance improvements.
- Observability improvements across the stack.

## Adopt now

- Use improvements to standardize trace/metric conventions (avoid ad-hoc logging as observability).

## Evaluate

- Adopt only when required; keep a follow-on LTS landing plan.

## Avoid / caution

- Treating .NET 7 as an endpoint for production baselines.
