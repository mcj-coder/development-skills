## Adopt now

- Standardize minimal hosting conventions for consistent `Program.cs` shape.
- Use Minimal APIs where they materially reduce ceremony for simple endpoints.

## Evaluate

- Consolidate legacy Startup patterns only where it improves clarity (avoid churn-only refactors).

## Avoid / caution

- Mixing multiple hosting/startup conventions across services without standards.
