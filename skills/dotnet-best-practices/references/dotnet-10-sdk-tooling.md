# .NET 10 SDK and tooling

## Adopt now

- Pin SDK versions in CI; align developer toolchains to avoid build drift.
- Use improved diagnostics to raise signal quality (clean warnings; remove noisy logs).

## Evaluate

- **File-based apps enhancements**
  - Consider for small utilities/services where simplified structure and publish options matter.

## Avoid / caution

- Allowing toolchain drift across CI agents and developer machines.
