## Project Overview

[Brief description of what this project does and its purpose.]

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [REPO-URL]
cd [PROJECT-NAME]

# Install dependencies
[INSTALL-COMMAND]

# Run tests
[TEST-COMMAND]

# Start development
[DEV-COMMAND]
```

## Critical Standards

These are non-negotiable. Full details in AGENTS.md.

### TDD is Mandatory

- ALL changes require TDD - code, config, AND documentation
- No "verify after" - write failing test/checklist FIRST
- Documentation uses BDD checklists as tests

### Issue-Driven Workflow

- No changes without a GitHub issue (read-only work exempt)
- Reference issues in commits, PRs, and comments
- Never commit directly to `main` - use feature branches

### Clean Build Principle

- Zero tolerance for warnings or errors
- All linting must pass before committing
- Run: `[LINT-COMMAND]` to verify

---

## Quality Commands

```bash
[LINT-COMMAND]          # Run all linting
[TEST-COMMAND]          # Run tests
[BUILD-COMMAND]         # Build project
```
