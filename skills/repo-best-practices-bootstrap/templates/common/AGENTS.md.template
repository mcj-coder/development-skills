# Agent Guidelines

## Agent Execution Rules

Agents must follow the standards in `README.md` before taking any action.
These rules tighten the workflow for autonomous execution.

- **Skills-first enforcement.** Bootstrap, load skills, and follow process
  skills before any implementation.
- **No changes without an issue.** All non-read-only work must be tied
  to a GitHub/taskboard issue.
- **TDD enforcement.** Apply TDD standard - failing test before implementation.
- **Feature branch only.** Do not commit on main/master.

## Prerequisites First

Before any task or response in this repo:

1. Load skill library and apply `using-superpowers` (if using Superpowers)
2. Read and understand `README.md` and this file
3. Load relevant skills for the task

## Skill Library Setup

Install and configure skill libraries:

- **Superpowers**: https://github.com/obra/superpowers (optional but recommended)
- Add project-specific skills as needed

## No Implementation First

Jumping straight into implementation is an exception and must be explicitly
requested by the user. The default is to load and apply skills before any repo
actions.

## Commit Standards

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Reference issue numbers: `fixes #123` or `refs #123`
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes following TDD
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Ensure all linting passes
5. Create PR with description referencing issue
6. Address review feedback
7. Merge when approved
