# Walking Skeleton Scope Checklist

Use this checklist to maintain minimal scope during skeleton implementation.

## Before Starting

- [ ] Goal defined: What architecture question are we answering?
- [ ] Success criteria defined: How do we know the skeleton works?
- [ ] Out of scope documented: What are we explicitly deferring?

## Minimal Components (Include)

### API Layer

- [ ] One health check endpoint (GET /health)
- [ ] One resource endpoint (GET or POST)
- [ ] Basic request/response model

### Persistence

- [ ] Single database connection
- [ ] One table/collection
- [ ] Basic CRUD for one entity

### Observability

- [ ] Health check endpoint
- [ ] Basic logging (structured preferred)

### Deployment

- [ ] Single deployment target (dev/staging)
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Container or serverless packaging

### Testing

- [ ] One BDD acceptance test
- [ ] Covers end-to-end flow

## Scope Creep Warning Signs

Stop and defer if you're adding:

- [ ] ❌ Authentication/authorization
- [ ] ❌ Multiple entity relationships
- [ ] ❌ Complex validation rules
- [ ] ❌ Error handling beyond basics
- [ ] ❌ Performance optimization
- [ ] ❌ Multiple environments
- [ ] ❌ Additional endpoints beyond one
- [ ] ❌ UI/frontend (unless specifically validating)

## Completion Criteria

Skeleton is complete when:

- [ ] BDD test passes in deployed environment
- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] Data persists (POST then GET works)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline runs successfully twice
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented in ADR

## Next Steps After Skeleton

1. [ ] Document learnings from skeleton validation
2. [ ] Update architecture ADR with findings
3. [ ] Create feature backlog building on skeleton
4. [ ] Begin incremental feature delivery
