# ADR-NNNN: Walking Skeleton Architecture

## Status

Proposed | Accepted | Superseded

## Context

<!-- What is the situation that requires a walking skeleton? -->

We are building [system name] and need to validate the architecture before
full implementation. Key uncertainties include:

- [Technology choice]
- [Integration pattern]
- [Deployment approach]

## Decision

We will build a walking skeleton that proves:

1. [Key architectural concern 1]
2. [Key architectural concern 2]
3. [End-to-end deployment works]

### Skeleton Scope

**IN SCOPE (minimal viable slice):**

- [ ] Single HTTP endpoint (GET /health or POST /api/resource)
- [ ] Basic persistence (one table/collection)
- [ ] Health check endpoint
- [ ] Deployment pipeline to [target environment]
- [ ] One BDD acceptance test

**OUT OF SCOPE (deferred to feature work):**

- [ ] Business logic beyond trivial
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Multiple entity relationships
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Technology Choices

| Component    | Choice     | Rationale                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| API          | [Framework] | [Why this choice]         |
| Persistence  | [Database]  | [Why this choice]         |
| Deployment   | [Platform]  | [Why this choice]         |
| Testing      | [Framework] | [Why this choice]         |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Architecture validated before significant investment
- Deployment pipeline established early
- Team gains confidence in technical decisions

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain minimal scope
- May feel slow initially before feature work

### Risks

- Scope creep into feature work
- Skeleton becomes throwaway code (should be production quality)

## Validation Criteria

Skeleton is complete when:

- [ ] BDD acceptance test passes in deployed environment
- [ ] Health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] Data persists across restarts
- [ ] Deployment is repeatable (run pipeline twice)

## Next Steps

After skeleton validation:

1. Document learnings and update this ADR
2. Create feature backlog based on skeleton foundation
3. Begin incremental feature delivery
