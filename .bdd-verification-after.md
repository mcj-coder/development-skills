# BDD Verification: After Changes

## Test Date
2026-01-06 (After implementation)

## Expected Result
ALL criteria should PASS (documentation complete)

## Verification Checklist

### 1. AGENTS.md explicitly states when to create taskboard issues (before vs during)

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 8-16):**
```markdown
- **No changes without a Taskboard issue.** All non-read-only work must be tied
  to a Taskboard issue **before starting work**. Create the issue first, then
  begin implementation.
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Line 9 explicitly states "**before starting work**" and "Create the issue first, then begin implementation." Clear timing requirement.

---

### 2. AGENTS.md defines read-only work clearly (with examples)

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 11-12):**
```markdown
  - **Read-only work** (no ticket required): Code viewing, analysis, research,
    documentation reading, answering questions, providing reviews
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Explicit definition with 6 concrete examples. Clear what qualifies as read-only.

---

### 3. AGENTS.md defines non-read-only work clearly (with examples)

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 13-14):**
```markdown
  - **Non-read-only work** (ticket required): File edits, commits, PRs, branch
    creation, configuration changes, documentation updates
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Explicit definition with 6 concrete examples. Clear what requires a ticket.

---

### 4. AGENTS.md documents issue state workflow

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 45-113):**
- Section title: "Taskboard Workflow" (line 45)
- "Issue Lifecycle:" (lines 50-87) with 5 states documented:
  1. New Feature / Bug / Enhancement
  2. Refinement (Planning phase)
  3. Implementation (Execution phase)
  4. Verification (Quality assurance phase)
  5. Complete (Closed)
- Each state includes specific actions and assignments
- "State Transition Rules" (lines 89-94)

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Comprehensive state workflow documented with lifecycle, transitions, and rules.

---

### 5. AGENTS.md documents traceability format (commits, PRs)

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 19-20):**
```markdown
  - **Format:** Reference issue in commit messages (`Refs: #123`), PR titles and
    descriptions, and issue comments with evidence links
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Explicit format specified with example (`Refs: #123`). Covers commits, PRs, and issue comments.

---

### 6. AGENTS.md documents evidence requirements

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 21-22, 96-102):**
```markdown
  - **Evidence:** Link commits (SHA URLs), PRs, and verification results in
    issue comments
```

Plus detailed evidence requirements section (lines 96-102):
```markdown
**Evidence Requirements:**

Each state transition requires specific evidence posted to issue comments:

- **Refinement → Implementation:** Link to approved plan (commit SHA URL)
- **Implementation → Verification:** Links to commits, PRs, implementation evidence
- **Verification → Complete:** Links to test results, review approvals, merged PRs
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Evidence requirements documented both in baseline rule and in workflow section with specific requirements per state transition.

---

### 7. AGENTS.md documents issue closure criteria

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 40-43, 82-87):**

Baseline rule (lines 40-43):
```markdown
- **Issue closure after scope complete.** When all in-scope work for an issue is
  delivered (all required PRs merged), post final evidence comment and close the
  issue. If issue requires multiple PRs, keep open until all scope delivered or
  remaining work moved to new ticket. Do not leave issues open after all work complete.
```

Workflow section (lines 82-87):
```markdown
5. **Complete** (Closed)
   - All PRs merged
   - Final evidence comment posted with links to PRs and commits
   - Acceptance criteria verified as met
   - Issue closed
   - Auto-unassigns on close
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Clear closure criteria: scope complete, PRs merged, evidence posted, acceptance criteria met. Documented in both baseline rules and workflow section.

---

### 8. AGENTS.md references Superpowers skills if overlap found

**Updated State (AGENTS.md lines 104-113):**
```markdown
**Implementation Skills:**

The baseline taskboard requirement can be implemented using:

- **Full workflow:** `development-skills:issue-driven-delivery` (comprehensive
  issue-driven process with plans, approvals, sub-tasks, and reviews)
- **Agent automation:** `development-skills:agent-workitem-automation` (automated
  agent interaction with taskboard and step updates)

These skills build on the mandatory baseline established in this section.
```

**Cross-check finding:** No overlap with Superpowers taskboard skills (Superpowers provides process skills, not taskboard). Overlap with this repo's own skills (`issue-driven-delivery`, `agent-workitem-automation`).

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** AGENTS.md correctly references the implementation skills from this repository. No Superpowers taskboard skills exist to reference (cross-check confirmed). Clarifies relationship: AGENTS.md is mandatory baseline, skills are implementation patterns.

---

### 9. README.md maintains human-readable taskboard link

**Current State (README.md lines 7-9):**
```markdown
## Work Items

Taskboard: <https://github.com/mcj-coder/development-skills/issues>
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Unchanged from before. Clear, human-readable taskboard link remains in README.md.

---

### 10. No conflicts between this repo's requirements and Superpowers patterns

**Cross-check findings:**
- Superpowers provides: process skills (brainstorming, TDD, verification, code review)
- This repo provides: taskboard workflow skills (issue-driven-delivery, agent-workitem-automation)
- No overlapping requirements
- Complementary relationship: Superpowers = process discipline, this repo = taskboard workflows

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Cross-check completed. No conflicts found. Superpowers and this repo address different concerns (process vs taskboard).

---

## Summary

**Results:**
- ✅ PASS: 10/10 (100%)
- ❌ FAIL: 0/10 (0%)
- ⏳ DEFERRED: 0/10 (0%)

**Pass Rate:** 100%

**Conclusion:** ✅ BDD TEST PASSES COMPLETELY

All criteria now pass. The enhanced documentation addresses all gaps identified in the "before" verification:

**Enhancements Made:**

1. ✅ **Timing clarified:** "before starting work" explicitly stated
2. ✅ **Read-only work defined:** 6 examples provided
3. ✅ **Non-read-only work defined:** 6 examples provided
4. ✅ **State workflow added:** Complete 5-state lifecycle with transition rules
5. ✅ **Traceability format specified:** Commit message format, PR references, evidence links
6. ✅ **Evidence requirements documented:** Specific requirements per state transition
7. ✅ **Closure criteria enhanced:** Already good, reinforced in workflow section
8. ✅ **Skills referenced:** Implementation skills clearly linked as complementary
9. ✅ **README.md preserved:** Taskboard link unchanged
10. ✅ **No conflicts:** Cross-check confirmed complementary relationship

**Quality Assessment:**

- **Completeness:** All acceptance criteria addressed
- **Clarity:** Explicit examples and definitions throughout
- **Actionability:** Clear "what to do when" guidance
- **Consistency:** No contradictions between sections
- **Traceability:** Cross-references between baseline rules and workflow section

**Next Step:** Proceed to QA verification (Step 6).
