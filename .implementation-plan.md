# Implementation Plan: Issue #41 - Baseline Practice: Taskboard Traceability

## Issue Reference
- **Issue:** #41
- **Title:** Baseline practice: taskboard traceability
- **State:** Refinement

## Current State Analysis

### AGENTS.md Current Content
Lines 8-11 already contain taskboard requirement:
```markdown
- **No changes without a Taskboard issue.** All non-read-only work must be tied
  to a Taskboard issue. Read-only work and reviews are allowed without a ticket.
- **Traceability required.** Every change must be traceable to a Taskboard
  issue; create one if it does not exist.
```

### README.md Current Content
Lines 8-9 contain taskboard link:
```markdown
## Work Items

Taskboard: <https://github.com/mcj-coder/development-skills/issues>
```

### Gap Analysis
- AGENTS.md already documents taskboard requirement (lines 8-11)
- README.md already retains taskboard link for humans (lines 8-9)
- **Issue:** Current documentation is INCOMPLETE - lacks critical details about:
  1. When to create issues (before vs during work)
  2. Issue state transitions and workflow
  3. Evidence requirements and traceability format
  4. Read-only vs non-read-only distinction clarity
  5. Review activities and whether they need tickets

## Acceptance Criteria from Issue

1. ✅ AGENTS.md documents taskboard requirement (exists but needs enhancement)
2. ✅ README retains taskboard link for humans (exists)
3. ⏳ Cross-check with Superpowers skills for overlap (pending)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enhance AGENTS.md Documentation
**Goal:** Make taskboard traceability requirements explicit and actionable.

**Changes Required:**
1. Expand the "No changes without a Taskboard issue" rule to include:
   - When to create issues (always BEFORE non-read-only work)
   - What qualifies as "read-only work" (viewing code, analysis, answering questions)
   - What qualifies as "non-read-only work" (file edits, commits, PRs)
   - Issue state expectations (should be in appropriate state before work starts)

2. Expand the "Traceability required" rule to include:
   - Format for traceability (issue references in commits, PRs, comments)
   - Evidence requirements (link issue in PR, reference in commit messages)
   - How to handle work discovered mid-implementation (create issue immediately)

3. Add new section: "Taskboard Workflow" with:
   - Issue lifecycle (new → refinement → implementation → verification → done)
   - When to transition states
   - Required evidence at each stage
   - Issue closure criteria

**Location:** AGENTS.md, lines 8-11 (expand this section)

### Step 2: Verify README.md Taskboard Link
**Goal:** Ensure human-readable taskboard reference remains clear and accessible.

**Changes Required:**
- Verify lines 8-9 are sufficient for human discovery
- No changes needed unless Tech Lead requests enhancement

**Location:** README.md, lines 8-9

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Superpowers Skills
**Goal:** Identify and document any overlap with Superpowers taskboard/traceability skills.

**Actions:**
1. Search for Superpowers skills related to:
   - Issue tracking/taskboard workflows
   - Work item management
   - Traceability requirements
2. Document findings in implementation plan
3. If overlap found:
   - Reference Superpowers skills in AGENTS.md
   - Document complementary vs duplicate requirements
   - Ensure no conflicts in requirements

**Note:** Based on available context, there are references to:
- `issue-driven-delivery` (in this repo, requires ticketing CLI)
- `agent-workitem-automation` (in this repo, requires work item system CLI)
- Superpowers installation is mentioned but specific skills not enumerated in current files

**Assumption:** This step will verify there are no conflicting requirements and that AGENTS.md can reference Superpowers patterns if applicable.

### Step 4: Create BDD Test/Verification Checklist
**Goal:** Define passing criteria before making changes (TDD for docs).

**Checklist (Must FAIL before changes):**
- [ ] AGENTS.md explicitly states when to create taskboard issues (before vs during)
- [ ] AGENTS.md defines read-only work clearly (with examples)
- [ ] AGENTS.md defines non-read-only work clearly (with examples)
- [ ] AGENTS.md documents issue state workflow
- [ ] AGENTS.md documents traceability format (commits, PRs)
- [ ] AGENTS.md documents evidence requirements
- [ ] AGENTS.md documents issue closure criteria
- [ ] AGENTS.md references Superpowers skills if overlap found
- [ ] README.md maintains human-readable taskboard link
- [ ] No conflicts between this repo's requirements and Superpowers patterns

### Step 5: Implement Changes
**Execution:**
1. Run BDD checklist against current docs (expect failures)
2. Edit AGENTS.md per Step 1 changes
3. Verify README.md per Step 2 (likely no changes)
4. Re-run BDD checklist (expect all passing)

### Step 6: Verification
**QA Role Actions:**
1. Verify all BDD checklist items pass
2. Verify AGENTS.md changes are clear and actionable
3. Verify no conflicts with existing AGENTS.md content
4. Verify README.md taskboard link remains intact
5. Check for any typos, formatting issues, or broken references

### Step 7: Role-Based Review
**Documentation Expert Review:**
- Review AGENTS.md changes for clarity, completeness, and consistency
- Verify documentation structure follows repository standards
- Confirm human-readable terminology used appropriately
- Check cross-references are correct

### Step 8: Address Critical Issues
- Fix any critical issues identified in verification or reviews
- Update plan if scope changes required

### Step 9: Create Pull Request
**After verification and reviews complete:**
- Create PR with descriptive title and body
- Reference issue #41
- Include evidence of verification passing
- Include evidence of review completion

### Step 10: Tech Lead PR Approval
- Request Tech Lead review of PR
- Address any feedback
- Obtain approval before merge

### Step 11: Merge PR
**After Tech Lead approval:**
- Merge PR using repository merge policy (rebase + squash/fast-forward)
- Use Conventional Commit message with issue reference

### Step 12: Post Evidence and Close Issue
- Post final evidence comment to issue #41 with:
  - Link to merged PR
  - Link to commit SHA
  - Confirmation all acceptance criteria met
- Close issue #41
- Note: This unblocks dependent issues waiting for baseline practice

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Overlap with Superpowers creates conflicting requirements | High | Cross-check thoroughly; document complementary relationship |
| AGENTS.md becomes too verbose | Medium | Keep rules concise; use examples sparingly; link to external docs if needed |
| Changes break existing agent workflows | High | Follow TDD; verify against existing patterns; test with sample scenarios |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] AGENTS.md enhanced with comprehensive taskboard traceability requirements
- [ ] README.md taskboard link retained and verified
- [ ] Superpowers skills cross-checked; no conflicts documented
- [ ] BDD verification checklist passes completely
- [ ] Documentation Expert review complete and approved
- [ ] QA verification complete and passing
- [ ] PR created with all evidence
- [ ] Tech Lead approves PR
- [ ] PR merged successfully
- [ ] Issue #41 closed with evidence
- [ ] Dependent issues unblocked

## Dependencies

- None (this is a baseline practice that unblocks other issues)

## Estimated Effort

- Plan creation: 30 minutes ✅
- Implementation: 45 minutes
- Verification: 20 minutes
- Reviews: 30 minutes
- PR and closure: 15 minutes
- **Total: ~2.5 hours**

## Notes

This is a critical baseline practice. Many other issues are blocked waiting for
this to be established. Quality and completeness are more important than speed.
