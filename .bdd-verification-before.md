# BDD Verification: Before Changes

## Test Date
2026-01-06 (Before implementation)

## Expected Result
ALL criteria should FAIL (documentation incomplete)

## Verification Checklist

### 1. AGENTS.md explicitly states when to create taskboard issues (before vs during)

**Current State (AGENTS.md lines 8-11):**
```markdown
- **No changes without a Taskboard issue.** All non-read-only work must be tied
  to a Taskboard issue. Read-only work and reviews are allowed without a ticket.
- **Traceability required.** Every change must be traceable to a Taskboard
  issue; create one if it does not exist.
```

**Finding:** ❌ FAIL
**Reason:** States "create one if it does not exist" but doesn't explicitly say WHEN (before starting work vs during work). Ambiguous whether to create before or during.

---

### 2. AGENTS.md defines read-only work clearly (with examples)

**Current State:**
"Read-only work and reviews are allowed without a ticket."

**Finding:** ❌ FAIL
**Reason:** Mentions "read-only work" but provides NO examples. Unclear what qualifies (code viewing? analysis? research? documentation reading?).

---

### 3. AGENTS.md defines non-read-only work clearly (with examples)

**Current State:**
"All non-read-only work must be tied to a Taskboard issue."

**Finding:** ❌ FAIL
**Reason:** Mentions "non-read-only work" but provides NO examples. Unclear what qualifies (file edits? commits? PRs? branch creation?).

---

### 4. AGENTS.md documents issue state workflow

**Current State:**
No mention of issue states or workflow.

**Finding:** ❌ FAIL
**Reason:** No documentation of issue lifecycle (new → refinement → implementation → verification → done). No state transition rules.

---

### 5. AGENTS.md documents traceability format (commits, PRs)

**Current State:**
"Every change must be traceable to a Taskboard issue"

**Finding:** ❌ FAIL
**Reason:** States traceability required but doesn't specify HOW (commit message format? PR references? issue comments?). No format examples.

---

### 6. AGENTS.md documents evidence requirements

**Current State:**
No mention of evidence.

**Finding:** ❌ FAIL
**Reason:** No documentation of what evidence is required at each stage (issue comments? PR descriptions? commit SHAs?).

---

### 7. AGENTS.md documents issue closure criteria

**Current State (lines 27-30):**
```markdown
- **Issue closure after scope complete.** When all in-scope work for an issue is
  delivered (all required PRs merged), post final evidence comment and close the
  issue. If issue requires multiple PRs, keep open until all scope delivered or
  remaining work moved to new ticket. Do not leave issues open after all work complete.
```

**Finding:** ✅ PARTIAL PASS (50%)
**Reason:**
- ✅ States when to close (after scope complete, PRs merged)
- ✅ Mentions final evidence comment
- ❌ Doesn't specify what qualifies as "scope complete"
- ❌ Doesn't specify evidence format
- ❌ Doesn't link to state workflow

**Decision:** Count as FAIL since only partial compliance.

---

### 8. AGENTS.md references Superpowers skills if overlap found

**Current State:**
Multiple references to Superpowers throughout AGENTS.md but no specific references to taskboard/traceability skills.

**Finding:** ⏳ PENDING
**Reason:** Cannot evaluate until Superpowers cross-check complete (Step 3 of plan). Will verify after cross-check determines if overlap exists.

**Temporary Status:** DEFERRED (will retest after cross-check)

---

### 9. README.md maintains human-readable taskboard link

**Current State (README.md lines 8-9):**
```markdown
## Work Items

Taskboard: <https://github.com/mcj-coder/development-skills/issues>
```

**Finding:** ✅ PASS
**Reason:** Clear, human-readable taskboard link present in README.md. Section title "Work Items" is clear.

---

### 10. No conflicts between this repo's requirements and Superpowers patterns

**Current State:**
Cannot evaluate without Superpowers cross-check.

**Finding:** ⏳ PENDING
**Reason:** Requires completion of Step 3 (Superpowers cross-check). Will verify after cross-check.

**Temporary Status:** DEFERRED (will retest after cross-check)

---

## Summary

**Results:**
- ✅ PASS: 1/10 (10%)
- ❌ FAIL: 7/10 (70%)
- ⏳ DEFERRED: 2/10 (20%)

**Pass Rate (excluding deferred):** 1/8 = 12.5%

**Conclusion:** ✅ BDD TEST CORRECTLY FAILS

The BDD checklist correctly identifies that current documentation is incomplete. Most criteria (7/8 testable criteria) fail, confirming the gap analysis was accurate.

**Next Step:** Proceed with implementation (Step 5) to address failures.
