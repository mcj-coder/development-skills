# QA Verification Report: Issue #41

## QA Date
2026-01-06

## QA Role
Quality Assurance Engineer

## Scope
Verify taskboard traceability baseline practice documentation (AGENTS.md enhancements)

## Verification Checklist

### 1. BDD Checklist Pass/Fail

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
- `.bdd-verification-before.md`: 1/8 testable criteria passed (12.5%) - correctly failed
- `.bdd-verification-after.md`: 10/10 criteria passed (100%) - all pass

**Assessment:** BDD verification correctly identified gaps, implementation addressed all gaps, post-implementation verification confirms all criteria met.

### 2. AGENTS.md Changes Clear and Actionable

**Review Areas:**

**A. Baseline Rules Enhancement (Lines 8-24)**

**Clarity:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- "before starting work" is unambiguous
- Read-only vs non-read-only distinction crystal clear
- Examples make rules immediately actionable

**Actionability:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Specific examples for both categories
- Clear format for issue references (`Refs: #123`)
- Explicit timing ("Create the issue first, then begin implementation")

**Completeness:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Covers all common scenarios
- Handles edge case (mid-implementation discovery)
- Links format, evidence, and timing

**B. Taskboard Workflow Section (Lines 45-113)**

**Clarity:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- 5-state lifecycle clearly defined
- Each state has specific actions listed
- Transition rules are explicit

**Actionability:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Self-assignment pattern clearly explained
- Evidence requirements specific per transition
- Skills references provide implementation guidance

**Completeness:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Full lifecycle documented
- State transition rules included
- Evidence requirements per transition
- Skills complementarity explained

**C. Cross-References and Consistency**

**Internal Consistency:** ✅ PASS
- Baseline rules (lines 8-24) align with Taskboard Workflow (lines 45-113)
- Issue closure rule (lines 40-43) consistent with Complete state (lines 82-87)
- No contradictions found

**Cross-References:** ✅ PASS
- Skills referenced correctly (`issue-driven-delivery`, `agent-workitem-automation`)
- Relationship clarified (baseline vs implementation)
- No broken references

---

### 3. No Conflicts with Existing AGENTS.md Content

**Conflict Check:**

**A. With Existing Rules**

✅ **NO CONFLICTS** - Enhanced rules extend existing content without contradiction:
- Line 8-11: Expanded "No changes without Taskboard issue" (was lines 8-9)
- Line 17-24: Expanded "Traceability required" (was lines 10-11)
- Line 40-43: "Issue closure after scope complete" unchanged
- New section (lines 45-113) adds detail, doesn't contradict

**B. With Skills-First Workflow**

✅ **NO CONFLICTS** - Taskboard workflow integrates with skills-first:
- Refinement phase (lines 57-64) compatible with `writing-plans` skill
- Implementation phase (lines 66-72) compatible with `test-driven-development` skill
- Verification phase (lines 74-80) compatible with `verification-before-completion` skill
- Skills referenced (lines 104-113) clarify complementary relationship

**C. With TDD Enforcement**

✅ **NO CONFLICTS** - Taskboard workflow supports TDD:
- Line 33-34: TDD enforcement rule unchanged
- Implementation phase mentions "Follow approved plan" (compatible with TDD)
- Verification phase mentions "Run tests" (supports TDD)

**D. With Feature Branch Policy**

✅ **NO CONFLICTS** - Taskboard workflow supports feature branches:
- Line 29-30: Feature branch rule unchanged
- Refinement phase: "Create implementation plan on feature branch" (line 59)
- Aligns with existing GitHub Flow requirement

---

### 4. README.md Taskboard Link Intact

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Verification:**
- README.md lines 7-9 unchanged
- Taskboard URL present: `https://github.com/mcj-coder/development-skills/issues`
- Section title clear: "Work Items"
- Human-readable format maintained

---

### 5. Typos, Formatting, and Broken References

**Spell Check:** ✅ PASS
- No typos identified
- Technical terms spelled correctly
- Consistent capitalization (Taskboard, PR, etc.)

**Formatting:** ✅ PASS
- Markdown syntax correct
- Bullet lists properly indented
- Code examples use backticks correctly
- Bold/emphasis used consistently

**References:** ✅ PASS
- Skill names correct: `development-skills:issue-driven-delivery`, `development-skills:agent-workitem-automation`
- No broken internal links
- Example format (`Refs: #123`) is valid

**Line Length:** ⚠️ REVIEW NEEDED
- Some lines may exceed markdownlint 120-char limit
- Will verify during commit (pre-commit hook will catch)

---

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
**None**

### Major Issues
**None**

### Minor Issues

**1. Potential Line Length Violations**

**Severity:** Minor
**Location:** Multiple lines in new Taskboard Workflow section
**Issue:** Some lines may exceed 120-character markdownlint limit
**Impact:** Pre-commit hook will fail if violations exist
**Recommendation:** Verify with markdownlint before commit; fix any violations

**Status:** Will be caught by pre-commit hook; can fix during commit phase
