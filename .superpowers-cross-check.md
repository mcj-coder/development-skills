# Superpowers Cross-Check: Taskboard Traceability

## Cross-Check Date
2026-01-06

## Purpose
Verify no conflicts between AGENTS.md taskboard requirements and Superpowers skills.

## Skills in This Repository

### 1. issue-driven-delivery
**File:** `skills/issue-driven-delivery/SKILL.md`

**Overlap Area:** Taskboard workflow, traceability, state management

**Key Features:**
- Work item state tracking (New Feature → Refinement → Implementation → Verification → Complete)
- Work item tagging (component, work type, priority, blocked)
- Evidence requirements (links in work item comments)
- Self-assignment pattern for pull-based coordination
- Plan approval workflow with commit SHA links
- Sub-task tracking with 1:1 mapping to plan tasks
- Issue closure criteria (scope complete, PRs merged, evidence posted)

**Read-Only vs Non-Read-Only:**
- Line 99-100: "Read-only work and reviews are allowed without a ticket"
- Line 98-99: "create the work item before making any changes"

**Traceability Format:**
- Lines 304-306: "Each sub-task comment includes links to exact commits and files"
- Lines 201-206: Commit SHA links for immutability

**Issue Closure:**
- Lines 291-300: Final evidence comment, close after all PRs merged, auto-unblock dependent issues

**Relationship to AGENTS.md:**
- **Complementary:** `issue-driven-delivery` is a *process skill* that implements the baseline requirement
- **AGENTS.md:** States the *mandatory baseline* requirement (all work needs ticket)
- **issue-driven-delivery:** Provides the *workflow implementation* (how to use tickets effectively)

**No Conflict:** AGENTS.md is the mandatory baseline; issue-driven-delivery builds on top

### 2. agent-workitem-automation
**File:** `skills/agent-workitem-automation/SKILL.md`

**Overlap Area:** Work item discovery, platform resolution, delivery completion

**Key Features:**
- Work item discovery via README.md "Work Items" section
- Platform resolution (GitHub/Azure DevOps/Jira)
- CLI setup automation
- Step update comment template
- Delivery completion criteria (all PRs merged, acceptance criteria met)
- Issue closure when scope complete

**Read-Only Work:**
- No explicit mention (defers to other skills)

**Traceability:**
- Lines 165-168: Step update comment template with evidence links
- Line 135: "Ensure the taskboard issue is updated with completion evidence"

**Issue Closure:**
- Lines 132-141: Close when all in-scope work delivered, PRs merged, acceptance criteria met
- Lines 139-141: Keep open if multiple PRs needed until all scope delivered

**Relationship to AGENTS.md:**
- **Complementary:** Focuses on agent-driven automation of work item management
- **AGENTS.md:** States baseline requirement for taskboard usage
- **agent-workitem-automation:** Automates the taskboard workflow for agents

**No Conflict:** Works within the baseline established by AGENTS.md

## Superpowers Skills Search

### Search Method
1. Checked local repository for references to Superpowers taskboard/traceability skills
2. Reviewed AGENTS.md for Superpowers skill references
3. Searched for patterns: "superpowers.*issue", "superpowers.*taskboard", "superpowers.*traceability"

### Findings
**No direct Superpowers taskboard/traceability skills found**

**Superpowers Skills Referenced in AGENTS.md:**
- Line 147: `superpowers:using-superpowers` (prerequisite loading)
- Line 163: `superpowers:brainstorming` (for unclear requirements)
- Line 164: `superpowers:writing-plans` (for multi-step tasks)
- Line 165: `superpowers:test-driven-development` (for code changes)
- Line 166: `superpowers:verification-before-completion` (always required)

**Superpowers Skills Referenced in this repo's skills:**
- `agent-workitem-automation` requires: `superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:test-driven-development`, `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
- `issue-driven-delivery` references: `superpowers:receiving-code-review` (line 279, line 311)

**Conclusion:** Superpowers provides *process* skills (brainstorming, TDD, verification, code review). It does NOT provide taskboard/traceability workflow skills. Those are provided by this repo's `issue-driven-delivery` and `agent-workitem-automation`.

## Conflict Analysis

### Potential Conflicts Identified
**None**

### Conflict Resolution
Not applicable - no conflicts found.

### Complementary Relationships

**AGENTS.md ↔ issue-driven-delivery:**
- AGENTS.md: "No changes without a Taskboard issue" (baseline requirement)
- issue-driven-delivery: Implements full workflow for using taskboard effectively
- Relationship: AGENTS.md is the mandatory rule; issue-driven-delivery is the implementation pattern

**AGENTS.md ↔ agent-workitem-automation:**
- AGENTS.md: Requires taskboard for all non-read-only work
- agent-workitem-automation: Automates agent's interaction with taskboard
- Relationship: AGENTS.md sets the policy; agent-workitem-automation provides automation

**AGENTS.md ↔ Superpowers:**
- AGENTS.md: References Superpowers process skills (brainstorming, TDD, verification)
- Superpowers: Provides process skills, not taskboard skills
- Relationship: Superpowers is a prerequisite dependency for process discipline

---

## Recommendations for AGENTS.md

### 1. Reference Complementary Skills
Add to AGENTS.md taskboard section:

```markdown
**Implementation Skills:**
- For full issue-driven workflow: Apply `development-skills:issue-driven-delivery`
- For agent automation: Apply `development-skills:agent-workitem-automation`
```

**Rationale:** Makes it clear that AGENTS.md establishes the baseline requirement, and skills provide implementation patterns.

### 2. No Changes Required for Superpowers
Superpowers does not provide taskboard/traceability skills, so no cross-reference needed in the taskboard section.

**Existing Superpowers references** (lines 147, 163-166) are already appropriate for process skills.

### 3. Maintain Clarity of Responsibility
- **AGENTS.md:** Mandatory baseline requirements (P0/P1 priority)
- **Skills:** Optional implementation patterns that follow the baseline

**Do NOT** make skills mandatory in AGENTS.md. Keep AGENTS.md focused on baseline requirements that apply to all contributors (human and agent).

## BDD Checklist Update

**Item #8:** "AGENTS.md references Superpowers skills if overlap found"

**Result:** ⏳ → ❌ FAIL (no overlap found, but should reference complementary skills)

**Updated Criteria:**
- AGENTS.md should reference `issue-driven-delivery` and `agent-workitem-automation` as implementation skills
- AGENTS.md should NOT add new Superpowers references (existing ones are sufficient)

**Item #10:** "No conflicts between this repo's requirements and Superpowers patterns"

**Result:** ⏳ → ✅ PASS (no conflicts found)

---

## Summary

### Overlap Found
✅ Yes - with this repo's own skills (`issue-driven-delivery`, `agent-workitem-automation`)

### Conflicts Found
❌ No conflicts

### Superpowers Involvement
- Superpowers provides **process skills** (brainstorming, TDD, verification)
- Superpowers does NOT provide **taskboard workflow skills**
- This repo's skills (`issue-driven-delivery`, `agent-workitem-automation`) provide taskboard workflows

### Recommendation
**Add skill references to AGENTS.md** to clarify that:
- AGENTS.md = mandatory baseline requirement
- `issue-driven-delivery` = full workflow implementation
- `agent-workitem-automation` = agent automation pattern

### No Breaking Changes Required
The existing AGENTS.md content is not wrong; it just needs enhancement to reference the implementation skills.
