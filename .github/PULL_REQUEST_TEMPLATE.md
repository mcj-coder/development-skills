When approving, include substantive feedback (>50 chars) such as:
- Files reviewed and verified
- Potential issues checked (edge cases, security, performance)
- Specific positive or constructive feedback

looks correct. Verified MIN_REVIEW_BODY_LENGTH constant is reasonable.
No security concerns with the new regex patterns."
